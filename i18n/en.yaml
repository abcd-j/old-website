- id: about_abcdj
  translation: "The ABCD-J research community project is a collaboration between five research
            institutions in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia: University Clinic
            RWTH Aachen, University Clinic Bonn, University Clinic Köln, University Clinic
            Düsseldorf and Research Centre Jülich. The overarching goal of ABCD-J is to
            elevate existing technical solutions for research practice adoption. From the
            social perspective, the ABCD-J project aims to promote and facilitate collaboration
            between multiple research centres, while from the technical perspective the project
            will accelerate research through homogenization of workflows and processes, with
            particular emphasis on digital biomarker development."

- id: about_platform
  translation: "The ABCD-J platform provides clinical researchers in the field of neurology and psychiatry
            with a digital infrastructure that allows 1) the collection of data using mobile health technologies, 
            2) the harmonization and management of data according to FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, 
            Reusable) principles, and 3) the automated analysis of data using machine learning algorithms with 
            the goal of developing digital biomarkers."

- id: about_datalad
  translation: "DataLad is a free and open source distributed data management system that keeps track of data, creates
            structure, ensures reproducibility, supports collaboration, and integrates with widely used data infrastructure."

- id: about_data_catalog
  translation: "The data catalog showcases a wide variety of datasets collected and shared
            by partner institutions in the ABCD-J community. Did you know that you can link your data to the catalog without having to upload it? "

- id: about_jtrack
  translation: "The JTrack platform consists of the two JTrack applications EMA and Social, and a server structure to enable 
            central data collection. The platform was developed to gather and study specific digital phenotyping information 
            about smartphone usage, sensor data and participants' daily lives. The JTrack platform was released as an open 
            source collaboration tool to enable clinical and behavioral researchers to collect their own digital phenotyping 
            data from specific study populations. In the framework of the ABCD-J project, JTrack will be integrated into clinical 
            studies across all partner sites, allowing for a harmonized and standardized evaluation of different clinical cohorts."

- id: about_julearn
  translation: "Machine learning workflows, including model assessment and comparison, are integrated 
            into a library known as 'julearn'. This library enables users to effortlessly design and test machine learning 
            models directly from pandas DataFrames, while maintaining the flexibility of utilizing scikit-learn's data processing 
            tools and models."
