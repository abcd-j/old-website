- id: about_abcdj
  translation: "The ABCD-J research community project is a collaboration between five research
            institutions in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia: University Clinic
            RWTH Aachen, University Clinic Bonn, University Clinic Köln, University Clinic
            Düsseldorf and Research Centre Jülich. The overarching goal of ABCD-J is to
            elevate existing technical solutions for research practice adoption. From the
            social perspective, the ABCD-J project aims to promote and facilitate collaboration
            between multiple research centres, while from the technical perspective the project
            will accelerate research through homogenization of workflows and processes, with
            particular emphasis on digital biomarker development."

- id: about_jtrack
  translation: "The JTrack platform consists of the two JTrack applications EMA and social and a server structure to enable 
            central data collection. The platform was developed to gather study specific digital phenotyping information 
            about smartphone usage, sensor data and participants' daily lives. The JTrack platform was released as an open 
            source collaboration tool to enable clinical and behavioral researchers to collect their own digital phenotyping 
            data from specific study populations. In the framework of the ABCD-J, JTrack will be integrated into clinical 
            studies across all partners allowing for a harmonized and standardized evaluation of different clinical cohorts."
