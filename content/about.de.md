## Verbundprojekt: Accessing Behavior for Clinical Data and Joint usage (ABCD-J)
### Eine Plattform für Verhaltensmarker der digitalen Neuromedizin in NRW


The ABCD-J research community project is a collaboration between five research
institutions in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia: University Clinic
RWTH Aachen, University Clinic Bonn, University Clinic Köln, University Clinic
Düsseldorf and Research Centre Jülich. The overarching goal of ABCD-J is to
elevate existing technical solutions for research practice adoption. From the
social perspective, the ABCD-J project aims to promote and facilitate collaboration
between multiple research centres, while from the technical perspective the project
will accelerate research through homogenization of workflows and processes, with
particular emphasis on digital biomarker development.
